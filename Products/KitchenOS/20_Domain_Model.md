# KitchenOS: Domain Model

> This document is the authoritative source for what KitchenOS knows and how it thinks. It defines the ubiquitous language, bounded contexts, aggregates, data model, and domain events. All engineers, AI agents, and product decisions should use the terms defined here exactly and consistently. Product decisions live in `10_Product_Vision.md`. Technical implementation of these concepts lives in `40_Technical_Architecture.md`.

---

## Ubiquitous Language

These terms have precise meanings within KitchenOS. Use them exactly as defined. Do not substitute synonyms.

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Household** | The primary unit of KitchenOS. One or more people sharing a kitchen, pantry, shopping, and food decisions. All data belongs to a Household. |
| **Person** | A human being in the KitchenOS domain. Owns stable, global facts about themselves: age group, health profile, dietary restrictions, and goals. A Person exists independently of any Household. The same Person can be a member of multiple Households. Person is a domain concept — not an auth concept, not an AI concept. Canonical shared entity: schema and cross-product rules in `Knowledge/Canonical_Data_Model.md`; this document defines the KitchenOS extension. |
| **HouseholdMembership** | The explicit relationship between a Person and a Household. Owns context-specific properties: role, permissions, joined date, status, and optional display nickname. A single Person can have multiple HouseholdMemberships. Membership is a first-class domain concept, not a join table. KitchenOS implementation of the canonical Relationship pattern (`Knowledge/Canonical_Data_Model.md`). |
| **PersonProfile** | The stable, explicitly-stated facts about a Person: age group, dietary restrictions, allergies, nutrition goals, and health context. These are business facts — not AI-learned beliefs. Never conflated with the Household Intelligence Model. |
| **Pantry** | The current known food inventory of a Household. Always a projection of pantry domain events. |
| **PantryItem** | A single food item in the Pantry with quantity, unit, and optional expiry. |
| **ShoppingList** | An ordered collection of items the Household intends to purchase. |
| **ShoppingItem** | A single item on a ShoppingList. Has a status: pending, purchased, or removed. |
| **Recipe** | A set of ingredients and instructions for preparing a meal. May be system-provided or expert-provided. |
| **WeeklyMealPlan** | The household's committed meal strategy for a week. Contains a collection of MealPlans, one per meal slot. Accepted in a single user action ("Accept Week"). No pantry change on acceptance — only MealSessions produce pantry events. The weekly plan is a living document: it adapts as pantry, leftovers, and schedules change. |
| **MealRecommendation** | An ephemeral AI output: a suggested meal with predicted participants, portions, and confidence score. Creates no commitment. No pantry change. Discarded if rejected or ignored. The Planning Layer. |
| **MealPlan** | A committed intention: a single meal the household plans to cook. Always belongs to a WeeklyMealPlan or created standalone. Contains confirmed participants and planned portions. Creates no pantry change — that only happens when a MealSession completes. The Intention Layer. |
| **MealSession** | Reality: a cooking and eating event that actually happened. A first-class domain aggregate owning confirmed participants, actual portions, leftovers, and the pantry changes produced by confirmed cooking completion — the source of truth for all pantry deductions from food consumption. The Execution Layer. |
| **Household Schedule Model** | An AI intelligence model (not a domain concept) representing the household's learned weekly routine: who eats on which nights, typical takeout nights, when guests visit, kids' activities, etc. Feeds the recommendation engine when generating weekly plans. Lives in the Intelligence Layer, not the Domain Model. |
| **Budget** | A spending target for grocery and food purchases. Tracked per period (weekly or monthly). |
| **Household Decision Engine** | The AI coordination layer that turns household context into safe, trusted food decisions. Never acts autonomously. Always produces recommendations for user approval. |
| **Allergy Guard** | The deterministic safety check that runs on every recommendation, substitution, and expert suggestion against household safety rules. Never bypassed. |
| **Household Timeline** | The user-facing, human-readable event log of the Household. A read model over the domain event stream. Distinct from the audit log. |
| **Domain Event** | An immutable record of something meaningful that happened in the Household. Written to the `domain_events` table. Never deleted. Every domain event belongs to exactly one Household — `household_id` is required on every event without exception. |
| **Household Context** | An application-layer concept (not a domain concept) representing the active household and member for the current session. Drives routing, permissions, UI state, and notifications. Does not persist when the app is closed. Defined in the Technical Architecture, not here. |
| **Command** | A user or system request to change household state. Commands produce events. The UI shows commands; the ledger records events. |
| **Reversal Event** | A domain event that reverses the effects of a prior event. Does not delete the original event. |
| **Correction Event** | A domain event that records a change in interpretation of a prior event (e.g., consumption re-classified as waste). |
| **Household Safety Rules** | Household-level allergy and dietary rules derived from individual member `dietary_constraints`. Never set independently. |
| **Expert** | A verified nutritionist, dietitian, fitness coach, or wellness practitioner who can access permissioned household data and provide plans. |
| **Provider** | The organisation or individual entity that Expert accounts belong to. May be an independent expert or a clinic, gym, or wellness company. |
| **Expert Plan** | A structured nutrition or fitness plan created by an Expert for a specific Member. Requires user approval before affecting household state. |
| **Expert Recommendation** | A specific suggestion within an Expert Plan (a meal, recipe, substitution, or shopping item). Must pass Allergy Guard and requires user approval. |
| **Consent Grant** | Explicit, scoped, time-bounded permission a Member gives an Expert to access specific household data. |
| **Cook Mode** | A UI capability that facilitates a Meal Session. Guides users step-by-step through a recipe. Cook Mode does not directly update the Pantry — it drives a Meal Session to completion, and the completed Meal Session produces the pantry update events. |
| **ShoppingTrip** | A real-world purchasing event, initiated by a Shopping List and completed by receipt scan or manual confirmation. The source of truth for all pantry additions from purchasing. |
| **Household Activity Lifecycle** | An architectural pattern (not a domain entity). Staged activities (MealSession, ShoppingTrip) follow Planned → Started → In Progress → Completed → Domain Events produced. Lightweight activities (WasteEvent, PantryCorrection, GiveawayEvent) are single-step: user confirms → Domain Events produced. |
| **WasteEvent** | A lightweight confirmed activity: food left the household as waste (thrown away, spilled, spoiled, expired). Produces `PantryItemThrownAway` or `PantryItemExpired`. Carries `waste_signal` learning impact. |
| **PantryCorrection** | A lightweight confirmed activity: the pantry record was wrong (miscount, lost item, incorrect entry). Produces `PantryItemQuantityCorrected` or `PantryItemConsumptionCorrected`. A miscount is not a behaviour — usually `no_learning` or `correction_signal`. |
| **GiveawayEvent** | A lightweight confirmed activity: an item left the household unconsumed and unwasted (donated, shared, given to family). Produces `PantryItemGivenAway`. Carries `surplus_signal` — often means over-purchasing, never counted as waste. |
| **Document Understanding** | The async capability that converts a scanned household document (receipts in MVP-0) into a structured proposal with per-field confidence for user confirmation. On confirmation: domain event → pantry update → budget update. Defined by ADR-012. |
| **Sync Engine** | The mobile component managing the SQLite pending event queue, conflict resolution on reconnect, and online/offline transitions. |
| **Staleness Indicator** | A visible UI signal that data may be outdated. Required whenever cached or offline data is shown. |
| **Learning Impact** | A field on domain events indicating whether the event should influence future AI recommendations. Some corrections explicitly carry `no_learning_impact`. |
| **Aggregate Root** | A DDD aggregate root: the single entry point for all state changes within an aggregate. Only the aggregate root can emit domain events for its aggregate. |

---

## Bounded Contexts

KitchenOS is organised into the following bounded contexts. Each context owns its domain events and data. No context mutates another context's primary tables directly — it emits events or calls domain services.

| Bounded Context | Owns | Events belong to |
|---|---|---|
| **Household** | Household, HouseholdMembership, roles, permissions, shared settings | `household.*` |
| **Person** | Person, PersonProfile, age group, health profile | `person.*` |
| **Profile & Safety** | Dietary restrictions, allergies, goals, household safety rules | `profile.*`, `safety.*` |
| **Receipt** | Receipt scanning, document understanding, item extraction, duplicate detection | `receipt.*` |
| **Pantry** | Pantry inventory, quantities, expiry, consumption, waste | `pantry.*` |
| **Shopping** | Shopping lists, items, purchase status | `shopping.*` |
| **Planning & Recipe** | Recipes, WeeklyMealPlans, MealPlans (intentions), MealRecommendations (ephemeral), substitutions | `planning.*` |
| **Cook Mode** | UI session state for step-by-step cooking guidance | `cook.*` |
| **Meal Session** | MealSession aggregate, participants, portions, leftovers, consumption events | `meal.*` |
| **Budget** | Grocery spend tracking, budget periods, reversals | `budget.*` |
| **Expert Marketplace** | Providers, experts, plans, recommendations, consent | `marketplace.*` |
| **Correction & Activity** | Reversal events, undo flows, Household Timeline grouping | `correction.*` |
| **Support** *(future)* | Support tickets, conversations, resolutions, escalations — customer-facing and expert-facing | `support.*` |

---

## Aggregate Roots

An aggregate root is the authoritative object for a cluster of related entities. All state changes within the aggregate go through the root.

### Household
The primary aggregate. Every other aggregate belongs to or references a Household.

**Entities within aggregate:** HouseholdMembership, HouseholdSafetyRules

**Invariants:**
- A Household is auto-created at account confirmation. The user never creates one manually.
- A Person record is created when an Identity is first confirmed. A default HouseholdMembership is created alongside the auto-created Household. There is no state where a confirmed Identity exists without a Person, a Household, and at least one HouseholdMembership.
- A single person living alone is a valid household of one. The model handles it identically to multi-member households.
- If onboarding is abandoned before completion, the household and membership records still exist. The system operates in a low-confidence state until more context is provided.
- A Household must always have at least one HouseholdMembership with `role: admin`.
- HouseholdSafetyRules are always derived from Member `dietary_constraints` — never set directly.
- **Every domain event must carry `household_id`. This is a non-negotiable domain rule. An event without a `household_id` is a bug.**

> **Design note — Household trends toward a Boundary, not a thick Aggregate.**
> If you strip everything to its own aggregate (Pantry, MealPlan, ShoppingTrip, Budget), Household owns almost nothing:
> `id, display_name, timezone, locale, created_at, status`. It acts as a namespace — the shared `household_id` on every event — rather than as a stateful aggregate.
> This is already the correct design. The label "Aggregate Root" is used here for Version 1 clarity.
> In a fully event-sourced system, Household should be modelled as a **Boundary** with its own thin event stream (created, renamed, archived) and all real state owned by the aggregates inside it.
> Formalize this in Version 2 when event-sourcing infrastructure is in place.

### Pantry
The current food inventory of a Household.

**Entities within aggregate:** PantryItem

**Invariants:**
- PantryItem quantity is never negative.
- Quantity changes always produce a domain event — no silent mutations.
- Deletions are modelled as `PantryItemThrownAway`, `PantryItemExpired`, or `PantryItemGivenAway` events, not hard deletes.
- **Pantry state is derived exclusively from confirmed household activities.** The pantry is never updated by a recommendation, a recipe, or a prediction. Only completed ShoppingTrips, completed MealSessions, confirmed WasteEvents, confirmed GiveawayEvents, and confirmed PantryCorrections may produce pantry update events. This is a non-negotiable invariant.

### Person
A human being in the KitchenOS domain. Global and portable across households.

**Entities within aggregate:** PersonProfile

**Invariants:**
- A Person is created when an Identity is first confirmed. It always exists independently of any Household.
- `PersonProfile` owns all stable facts about a Person: age group, dietary restrictions, allergies, goals, and any health measurements required by an active goal (e.g. height, weight). There is no separate `HealthProfile` — a profile-inside-a-profile adds indirection without adding clarity. All stable Person facts live flat on `PersonProfile`.
- Learned preferences (cuisine affinity, shopping habits, meal acceptance rates) are NOT part of Person. They belong to the Household Intelligence Model.
- A Person's allergies and goals travel with them to every Household they join. HouseholdMembership does not override PersonProfile facts.

### WeeklyMealPlan
The household's committed meal strategy for a week. Contains a set of MealPlans.

**Entities within aggregate:** MealPlan (one per meal slot)

**Invariants:**
- A WeeklyMealPlan is accepted in a single user action. All constituent MealPlans are created atomically.
- Accepting a WeeklyMealPlan does NOT update pantry, shopping list, or budget. Acceptance is commitment to intention, not execution.
- A WeeklyMealPlan is a living document. Individual MealPlans within it may be swapped, cancelled, or replaced as the week unfolds — without invalidating the whole plan.
- The AI may proactively suggest swaps mid-week based on pantry changes, expiry risk, schedule signals, or leftover availability. These are suggestions — the user confirms each swap.
- One WeeklyMealPlan per household per week. A household may have at most one active WeeklyMealPlan.

> **Design note — WeeklyMealPlan trends toward a Planning Horizon, not a thick Aggregate.**
> The week is a container for MealPlans, not an aggregate with its own business rules.
> In a future version consider modelling it as a `planning_horizon` (week_start + household_id) with MealPlans referencing it by FK — rather than a parent aggregate that owns child aggregates.
> The distinction: a Planning Horizon has no invariants of its own. It is simply a time-scoped grouping.
> Leave as an Aggregate Root in Version 1 for clarity. Revisit when the planning engine matures.

### MealRecommendation
An ephemeral AI output. The Planning Layer.

**Invariants:**
- A MealRecommendation commits nothing. It carries no household state.
- It holds predicted participants and a confidence score — these are AI beliefs, not confirmed facts.
- A MealRecommendation is accepted (→ creates a MealPlan), rejected (→ discarded), or expires (→ discarded). No other outcomes.
- Accepting a MealRecommendation does NOT update the pantry, shopping list, or budget.

### MealPlan
A committed intention for a single meal. The Intention Layer.

**Invariants:**
- A MealPlan belongs to a WeeklyMealPlan or is created standalone.
- It holds confirmed participants and planned portions — these are domain facts, not AI beliefs.
- A MealPlan does NOT update the pantry. Intention ≠ execution.
- A MealPlan transitions to a MealSession when the user starts cooking. If cooking never happens, the MealPlan expires without affecting any state.
- One MealPlan produces at most one MealSession.
- A MealPlan within a WeeklyMealPlan can be swapped or cancelled independently without affecting other MealPlans in the week.
- Every recipe attached to a MealPlan must pass Allergy Guard before being shown to the user.
- Expert-suggested MealPlans require explicit user approval before entering a WeeklyMealPlan.

### MealSession
Reality: a cooking and eating event that actually happened. The Execution Layer.

**Entities within aggregate:** MealSessionParticipant, MealSessionLeftover

**Invariants:**
- A MealSession is created when the user commits to cooking — tapping "Start Cooking" or equivalent.
- Confirmed participants are pre-filled from the MealPlan (or household defaults at high confidence). The user confirms or adjusts before cooking starts.
- Participants are identified by `person_id` — the Recommendation Engine loads each participant's PersonProfile to compute combined constraints.
- Pantry deductions are produced only when a MealSession reaches `status: completed` and the user confirms. Never on recommendation, plan creation, or cooking start.
- Leftovers are first-class: prepared portions minus consumed portions equals leftovers, which are recorded and optionally returned to the pantry as a new PantryItem.
- A MealSession can exist without a prior MealPlan (manual logging) and without Cook Mode (logged after the fact).
- Cook Mode is one UI path into a MealSession. It does not own pantry state.

### ShoppingList
An active or completed shopping list for a Household.

**Entities within aggregate:** ShoppingItem

**Invariants:**
- Items removed by user produce `ShoppingItemRemoved` (reversible). Hard deletes are not permitted.
- A ShoppingList may be AI-generated, user-created, or expert-suggested.

### ShoppingTrip
A real-world purchasing event. The Execution Layer for shopping — the exact parallel of `MealSession` for cooking.

**Entities within aggregate:** ShoppingTripItem, Receipt

**Invariants:**
- A ShoppingTrip is initiated from a ShoppingList (or manually). It does not create a ShoppingList retroactively.
- **Receipt is evidence, not the reality.** A receipt can be processed on its own or as part of a ShoppingTrip. Either way, `ReceiptItemsConfirmed` triggers `PantryItemsAddedFromReceipt` and `BudgetSpendRecorded`. A ShoppingTrip can also be completed without a receipt (manual confirmation).
- A ShoppingTrip may be supported by zero or more receipts that provide evidence of purchases made during the trip.
- Only confirmed purchases change household state.
- Duplicate receipt detection runs before confirmation. A duplicate receipt produces `ReceiptMarkedDuplicate` and blocks pantry additions.

> The shopping lifecycle mirrors cooking:
> ```
> ShoppingList (intention)  ←→  MealPlan (intention)
>         ↓                              ↓
> ShoppingTrip (reality)    ←→  MealSession (reality)
>         ↓                              ↓
> Pantry ADDED              ←→  Pantry DEDUCTED
> ```

### Lightweight Confirmed Activities: WasteEvent, PantryCorrection, GiveawayEvent

Not every confirmed activity is staged. MealSession and ShoppingTrip follow the full lifecycle because they take time in the real world. Waste, corrections, and giveaways happen in a moment — they are **single-step confirmed activities**: the user confirms, domain events are produced.

**Invariants:**
- Lightweight activities have no staged lifecycle and no persistent aggregate state — they exist as their confirmed domain events.
- They are still activities under ADR-010: user-confirmed, never inferred. The AI may *suggest* one ("this looks expired") — only the user confirms it.
- **WasteEvent** → `PantryItemThrownAway` or `PantryItemExpired` (`waste_signal`).
- **PantryCorrection** → `PantryItemQuantityCorrected` or `PantryItemConsumptionCorrected` (`no_learning` or `correction_signal`).
- **GiveawayEvent** → `PantryItemGivenAway` (`surplus_signal` — over-purchasing evidence, never counted as waste in learning or analytics).
- Every removal reason in the UX (`Products/KitchenOS/10_Product_Vision.md`, Section 59) maps to exactly one of these doors or to MealSession. "Remove item" is always a reclassification into *why the item is gone* — never a hard delete.

### Budget
Grocery spend tracking for a Household over a period.

**Invariants:**
- Budget spend is recorded by events from the Receipt context, not set directly.
- Reversals (e.g., duplicate receipt) produce `BudgetSpendReversed` events.

### Provider *(Expert Marketplace context)*
An organisation or individual that Expert accounts belong to.

**Entities within aggregate:** ProviderMember, ExpertProfile, ServiceOffering

**Invariants:**
- An ExpertProfile must belong to a Provider.
- An Expert can only access household data covered by an active ConsentGrant.

### ExpertPlan *(Expert Marketplace context)*
A structured plan created by an Expert for a Member.

**Entities within aggregate:** ExpertRecommendation

**Invariants:**
- Every ExpertRecommendation must pass Allergy Guard before the user sees it.
- No ExpertRecommendation may change household state without `user_approval_status: approved`.

> **Design note — Expert Marketplace will likely split into multiple aggregates.**
> As this context grows, `Provider`, `Expert`, `ConsentGrant`, `ExpertPlan`, and `ClientProviderRelationship` will each acquire enough invariants and event streams to justify being independent aggregate roots.
> For Version 1, grouping under Provider and ExpertPlan is sufficient.
> Before building this context, revisit whether these are truly one aggregate or five.

## Actor Model

KitchenOS interacts with multiple distinct actor types. Each actor has its own interface, permissions, and relationship to household data.

### Version 1 Actors

| Actor | Interface | Relationship to household |
|---|---|---|
| **Customer** | KitchenOS mobile app | Member of one or more households; all data scoped to their household |
| **Expert** | Expert Portal *(future)* | Accesses household data only within an active, scoped `ConsentGrant` |
| **AI** | Internal APIs | No direct interface; acts on behalf of household via recommendations |

### Future Actors (post-MVP)

| Actor | Interface | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Support Agent** | Support Console | Assists customers and experts; reads limited, scoped data for issue resolution |
| **Expert Operations** | Internal Admin Portal | Verifies expert credentials, manages onboarding, audits consent, monitors marketplace quality |
| **Operations Engineer** | Platform Operations Dashboard | Keeps the platform running; no access to household data |
| **Product Administrator** | Internal Admin Portal | Manages system-level configuration, feature flags, platform settings |
| **AI Agent** | Internal APIs | Autonomous agents acting on household data; always within user-granted boundaries |

> **Design note — Support as a future bounded context.**
> Customer Support is a **business capability**, not a platform capability. It owns domain objects with their own lifecycle:
> `SupportTicket`, `Conversation`, `SupportAgent`, `Escalation`, `Resolution`.
>
> Domain events it will produce:
> `SupportTicketCreated`, `SupportAgentAssigned`, `CustomerResponded`, `SupportAgentResponded`, `IssueResolved`, `IssueClosed`
>
> This is not part of Technical Architecture (auth/authz), nor Engineering Handbook (on-call/runbooks).
> It is a product context that will grow in importance as the marketplace matures — particularly Expert Operations:
> verifying credentials, handling disputes, auditing consent compliance, and monitoring marketplace quality.
>
> Model it as a bounded context in Version 2. Reserve `support.*` event namespace now.
> See `Products/KitchenOS/95_Customer_Expert_Operations/` for the operational workflows that sit above this domain context.

## Privacy-by-Design Principle

> **Collect only the information required to improve the user's experience.**

This principle governs every field in this data model. Before adding a column, the team must answer: what recommendation, safety check, or household decision does this field enable? If there is no clear answer, the field does not belong here.

Key decisions reflected in the data model:

- **Identity is isolated from intelligence.** The `identities` table (auth layer) is physically separate from the domain and intelligence schemas. The recommendation engine operates on `person_id` and `household_id` — never on names, emails, or `identity_id`.
- **Names are not stored internally.** A `display_name` field is optional and exists only for UI presentation. It is never used in recommendations, safety checks, or AI reasoning.
- **Age range, not exact age.** The system stores `age_group` (Adult, Child, Teen) and an optional `age_range` (e.g. 25–35) where needed for nutrition estimation. Exact birth dates are not required.
- **Sensitive data is scoped.** Height, weight, and medical conditions are stored only on the member who provides them, only when an active goal requires them, and are never visible to other household members by default.

See `Products/KitchenOS/10_Product_Vision.md`, Sections 8.10 and 8.11. See `ADR-009` for the full architectural decision.

---

## Data Model

Tables are organised by bounded context. The `domain_events` table is cross-cutting.

### Cross-Cutting: Events

```text
domain_events        ← append-only, cross-cutting. Full field specification lives in
                       one place: the Standard Event Envelope section below.
                       household_id is indexed; event_id is the primary key.
```

### Person and Household Context

```text
identities                         ← auth layer only; no domain or intelligence data lives here
  id                uuid
  email             string         the only PII stored; required for login and account recovery
  auth_provider     string         "google" | "apple" | "email"
  created_at        timestamptz

persons                            ← domain layer: stable facts about a human being
  id                uuid           person_id — used throughout profile, safety, meal session
  identity_id       uuid → identities.id   the only bridge to auth layer; never read by AI
  age_group         string         "adult" | "teen" | "child" | "infant"
  age_range         string, nullable   "18-24" | "25-34" | "35-44" | "45-54" | "55+"
  created_at        timestamptz

households
  id                uuid
  display_name      string, nullable   optional household name for UI only
  created_at        timestamptz

household_memberships              ← context layer: relationship between a Person and a Household
  id                uuid
  person_id         uuid → persons.id
  household_id      uuid → households.id
  role              string         "admin" | "member" | "caregiver" | "guest"
  status            string         "active" | "invited" | "suspended"
  joined_at         timestamptz
  display_name      string, nullable   optional nickname for UI display only; never used in AI
  included_in_meal_planning   boolean
  allergy_visibility          string  "household" | "private"
  goal_visibility             string  "household" | "private"
  notification_preferences    jsonb, nullable
```

**How the four layers connect:**

```text
identities
  id ──────────────────────────────────┐
  email                                │ identity_id (auth bridge — crossed once at login only)
  auth_provider                        │
                                       ↓
                                    persons
                                      id (person_id) ←── used by profile, safety, meal session, AI
                                      identity_id ──────── points back to identities; never read by AI
                                      age_group
                                      age_range
                                          │
                              ┌───────────┴────────────┐
                              │ person_id               │ person_id
                              ↓                         ↓
                  household_memberships          dietary_constraints
                    person_id                    user_goals
                    household_id ──┐             nutrition_preferences
                    role           │
                    status         ↓
                               households
                                 id
                                 display_name
```

Key points:

- `identities` → `persons`: crossed once at login to resolve `person_id`. Never crossed again by AI or intelligence layer.
- `persons` → `household_memberships`: one Person can have multiple memberships (one per household).
- `persons` → profile tables: dietary restrictions, goals, and preferences are owned by the Person, not the membership. They are global and travel with the person to every household.
- `household_memberships` → `households`: context only — role, permissions, notification prefs. No profile data.
- When a user logs in: `identity_id` → `person_id` → memberships resolved → Household Context assembled. After that, only `person_id` and `household_id` travel through the system.

> `identities` and `persons` must live in separate schemas. The `identity_id` bridge on `persons` must never be read by the intelligence layer, the Household Intelligence Model, or the Collective Intelligence pipeline. The recommendation engine receives only `person_id` and `household_id`.

### Profile & Safety Context

```text
dietary_constraints
  id                    uuid

## Standard Event Envelope

Every domain event shares this envelope. The `payload` field carries event-specific data.

```text
event_id            uuid            globally unique
event_type          string          PascalCase, e.g. "ItemConsumed"
event_version       integer         starts at 1; increment on breaking payload schema change
domain              string          bounded context name, e.g. "pantry"
household_id        uuid            always present
actor_type          string          "user" | "system" | "ai" | "expert"
actor_id            uuid            person_id, system process id, or expert_profile_id
source_type         string          "cook_mode" | "receipt_scan" | "manual" | "ai_recommendation" | "expert_plan"
entity_type         string          the aggregate type affected, e.g. "pantry_item"
entity_id           uuid            the affected entity
occurred_at         timestamptz     when the event happened (not when it was stored)
payload             jsonb           event-specific data
correlation_id      uuid            groups all events from one user action
causation_id        uuid            the event_id that caused this event (nullable)
reversal_of         uuid            the event_id being reversed or corrected (nullable)
learning_impact     string          "learning" | "no_learning" | "waste_signal" | "correction_signal" | "surplus_signal"
privacy_level       string          "household" | "member_only" | "expert_scoped"
```

**Key envelope fields:**

- `correlation_id` — one receipt scan produces multiple events (`ReceiptScanned`, `PantryItemsAddedFromReceipt`, `BudgetSpendRecorded`). All share the same `correlation_id`.
- `causation_id` — shows which event caused another. `PantryItemsAddedFromReceipt` is caused by `ReceiptItemsConfirmed`.
- `reversal_of` — links a reversal or correction event to the event it reverses. Never overwrite the original.
- `learning_impact` — tells the AI whether this event should influence future recommendations. Waste and corrections carry different signals than consumption.
- `privacy_level` — controls visibility: member-only constraints are not visible to other household members unless the member sets `allergy_visibility: household`.

---

## Business Invariants

These rules must hold at all times. They are not implementation details — they are domain facts. Violations require an ADR or an explicit exception record.

1. **Every meaningful household action produces a domain event.** No silent state changes. No soft deletes on domain data.

2. **Allergy Guard runs before any recommendation or expert suggestion reaches the user.** The check is deterministic and cannot be bypassed by AI output or expert instructions.

3. **Corrections and reversals are additional events, never mutations.** The original event is preserved permanently.

4. **Commands express user intent. Events express system fact.** The UI presents commands ("Remove item"). The ledger records events (`ShoppingItemRemoved`).

5. **`household_safety_rules` are derived from `dietary_constraints`, never set independently.** The derivation runs whenever a member's constraints change.

6. **User goals apply after safety constraints.** Safety always wins. A goal cannot override an allergy block.

7. **Expert recommendations require user approval before any household state change.** An `ExpertRecommendationApproved` event must exist before the recommendation affects pantry, shopping, or meal plan state.

8. **An Expert can only access data covered by an active, unexpired `ConsentGrant`.** Consent is scoped (e.g., pantry only) and time-bounded.

9. **The Household Timeline is a read model, not a primary table.** It is always reconstructable from the `domain_events` table.

10. **Staleness must always be visible.** Cached, offline, or stale data must carry a visible indicator. Implicit staleness is a trust failure.

11. **`event_version` must be incremented on any breaking change to an event's payload schema.** Consumers must handle multiple versions. Old versions must not be silently ignored.

---

## Intelligence Layer

> **This section describes the Intelligence Layer. It is not part of the Domain Model. It lives in a separate schema. It is included here so engineers and product designers understand what KitchenOS learns, where it learns it from, and how it stays separate from domain facts.**

The Intelligence Layer is KitchenOS's moat. Not the pantry. Not the recipes. Not the meal plans. The value is in what the system has learned about a household over time — and how it applies that learning to reduce effort while maintaining trust.

### What It Is Not

- It is not a domain aggregate. It owns no domain events.
- It does not write to any domain table. It only reads from the domain event stream.
- It does not override domain facts. A learned preference never replaces an explicit allergy or goal.
- It is replaceable. If the AI model changes, the intelligence layer is rebuilt from the event stream. The domain is unaffected.

### Sub-Models

```text
Household Intelligence Model
│
├── Preference Model
│   ├── Cuisine affinity (learned from MealSession completions and rejections)
│   ├── Ingredient preferences (liked / disliked / avoided)
│   ├── Cooking complexity preference (quick weeknight vs elaborate weekend)
│   └── Confidence scores per preference, evidence count, last-reinforced date
│
├── Consumption Model
│   ├── Pantry depletion rates per item category
│   ├── Typical portion sizes per person per meal type
│   ├── Leftover behaviour (how often leftovers are eaten vs wasted)
│   ├── Waste patterns per category (what expires unused)
│   └── Surplus patterns (what is given away — over-purchasing signal)
│
├── Shopping Model
│   ├── Store preferences and frequency
│   ├── Typical basket composition per store
│   ├── Price sensitivity per category
│   └── Buy-in-bulk vs buy-fresh preference per item
│
├── Schedule Model  (Household Schedule Model)
│   ├── Typical participants per meal slot per day of week
│   ├── Absence and travel patterns per person
│   ├── Takeout nights (frequency and day)
│   ├── Guest meal frequency
│   └── Confidence scores per slot; decays without reinforcement
│
├── Cooking Confidence Model
│   ├── Skill level inference (from Cook Mode abandonment and recipe complexity accepted)
│   ├── Preferred cook time range per meal type
│   └── Equipment signals (if smart appliances integrated)
│
└── Expert Interaction Model
    ├── Expert plan acceptance and rejection rates
    ├── Which recommendations were acted on vs ignored
    └── Goal progress signals (derived from MealSession nutrition data)
```

### Learning Sources

| Sub-Model | Primary event sources |
|---|---|
| Preference Model | `MealSessionCompleted`, `MealRecommendationRejected`, `MealPlanSwapped` |
| Consumption Model | `PantryItemConsumed`, `PantryItemThrownAway`, `PantryItemExpired`, `PantryItemGivenAway`, `LeftoversCreated` |
| Shopping Model | `ShoppingTripConfirmed`, `ReceiptItemsConfirmed`, `ShoppingItemRemoved` |
| Schedule Model | `MealSessionCompleted` (who participated), `MealPlanCancelled`, `WeeklyMealPlanAccepted` |
| Cooking Confidence | `CookModeSessionAbandoned`, `MealSessionCompleted` (recipe complexity) |
| Expert Interaction | `ExpertRecommendationApproved`, `ExpertRecommendationRejected` |

### Relationship to Domain Model

```text
Domain Events (immutable, append-only)
        │
        │  Learning Engine reads asynchronously
        ▼
Household Intelligence Model  (intelligence schema, separate)
        │
        │  Recommendation Engine reads synchronously at request time
        ▼
Recommendation output  →  user sees it  →  accepts or rejects  →  new domain event  →  loop
```

The Learning Engine never writes to domain tables. The Recommendation Engine never writes to domain tables. Domain facts are produced only by user-confirmed actions.

### Transparency and Control

Every sub-model must support:
- **Explainability**: the user can see what KitchenOS has learned about their household.
- **Correction**: the user can mark any inference as wrong.
- **Reset**: the user can erase any sub-model entirely.

This is a product requirement, not just a privacy posture. The household must always be in control of what the AI knows about them. See `ADR-009` and `10_Product_Vision.md`, Section 8.11.
